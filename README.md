Slide Form is a form builder for simple sliding forms. The index.js file has an example implementation of what SlideForm can do. Feel free to contribute and add features.

Download it using npm i sliform or visit [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sliform)

If you have a project that uses SlideForm, please open an issue so I can mention it.
